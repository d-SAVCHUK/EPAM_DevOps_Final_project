# EPAM DevOps Course Final project.

## 1. About me.

My name is Dmitry. I have over 10 years of experience in the financial sector. From February 2022, I entered the EPAM Univercity course for switchers - IT Fundamentals. Upon completion, I chose the DevOps L0 direction, after passing the tests I successfully moved to the L1 level. Articles that we studied:
DevOps Essentials L1: Linux + Bash, Database Administration, Networks using Linux, Cloud Basic, CI/CD & IaC & Containerisation (Jenkins), Terraform, Docker, Ansible.
DevOps Essentials L0: Hypervisor Essentials, Networking Essentials, ContOS Linux Essentials, Scripting: Bash Essentials, Vision control with Git, Python Essentials.
IT Fundamentals: Basics of Computer Science, Programming, Front End; Vision control with Git; Math for IT; Introduction to SQL; Software Development Methodologies; Cloud Overview.
Now I present the final project of the course.

## 2. Project requirements.

- host with git (Linux, MacOS, Windows: [possible on a virtual machine]);
- as a semantic part, you can choose an html page (index.html) with content of your choice.
- a cloud repository (GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket) where you will commit/push;
- CI/CD framework (Jenkins). The main purpose of Jenkis is to download the updated project from github and assemble it (build), and then place it in the artifact repository (delivery) or deploy it on the target server (deploy);
- configuration management tool (Ansible) â€“ can be used to set up machines and initial setup of your project environment;
- it is necessary that the Jenkins Master redirects jobs to its nodes (Slaves). In the case of a web page, this item can be omitted and immediately deployed to the target server.
- Docker and containerization can be used as follows - organize the launch of Jenkins and its nodes in containers and the target server also in the container.
